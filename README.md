# **Assessment Title 1: Forecasting the Daily Patronage using Time Series Forecasting at Canberra**

### **Overview:**

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict the daily number of patrons at a business establishment. It leverages historical patronage data, extracts relevant features, and employs various forecasting models to generate reliable future predictions.

### **Key Features:**

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares historical data by handling missing values, outliers, and temporal dependencies.

**Feature Engineering:** Extracts informative features like day of the week, seasonality, and promotional events to enhance forecast accuracy.

**Model Selection and Training:** Implements and compares different time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and VAR selecting the best one based on data characteristics and evaluation metrics.

**Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

**Visualization**: Creates interactive visualizations to showcase historical data, forecasts, and model evaluation results.
Technologies:

### Challenges Addressed:

**Seasonality:** Accounts for periodic fluctuations in patronage due to holidays, weekends, or seasonal trends.

**Event Impact:** Considers the influence of special events or holidays on customer footfall.

**Model Selection and Tuning:** Chooses the most suitable forecasting model and optimizes its parameters for improved accuracy.



# **Assessment Title 2: Project Title: Activity Recognition using Chest-Mounted Accelerometer Data**

## **Overview:**

This project builds a machine-learning model to predict human activities from chest-mounted accelerometer data. We leverage sensor readings to classify various daily activities such as walking, standing, sitting, climbing stairs, and more. This can be used for fitness tracking, healthcare applications, or even personalized user interfaces.

### **Key Features:**

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares raw accelerometer data by handling noise, outliers, and segmentation into relevant time windows.

**Feature Engineering:** Extracts informative features from time and frequency domains to characterize different activities.

**Model Selection and Training:** Implements and compares various classification models like KNN and Decision Trees based on data characteristics and performance metrics.

**Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Visualization:** Provides interactive visualizations of activity predictions, feature distributions, and model accuracy.
Technologies:

### **Challenges Addressed:**

**Sensor Noise and Outliers:** Robustly handle noise and outliers present in real-world sensor data.

**Feature Selection:** Choose the most relevant features that discriminatively represent different activities.

**Model Optimization:** Fine-tune model parameters and Hyperparameters for optimal performance.
