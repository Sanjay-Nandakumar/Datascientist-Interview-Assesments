# **Assessment Title 1: Forecasting the Daily Patronage using Time Series Forecasting at Canberra**

### **Overview:**

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict the daily number of patrons at a business establishment. It leverages historical patronage data, extracts relevant features, and employs various forecasting models to generate reliable future predictions.

### **Key Features:**

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares historical data by handling missing values, outliers, and temporal dependencies.

**Feature Engineering:** Extracts informative features like day of the week, seasonality, and promotional events to enhance forecast accuracy.

**Model Selection and Training:** Implements and compares different time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and VAR selecting the best one based on data characteristics and evaluation metrics.

**Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

**Visualization**: Creates interactive visualizations to showcase historical data, forecasts, and model evaluation results.
